# [frontend-store](https://frontend-store-05bc95.netlify.app/)
This is the second project from Juan Pablo's course of [Web Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/desarrollo-web-completo-con-html5-css3-js-php-y-mysql/).

> **Note:** Recently I've started to deploy my sites on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/), therefore I changed the domain's link to the new one (in the HTML and the README files), but I kept the screenshots that held the old domain (there's no reason for changing it, the result would've been the same with a different link only).

> **Disclaimer:** I'm starting to learn how to use **Git/Github** correctly, therefore there'll be plenty of pull requests, commits and other stuff as tests in this repository, however, *this won't represent my way of working forever*, I'll learn more things along the way as always :D!.

## What I learned
* This time I learned how to use the [SMACSS methodology](https://itnext.io/css-architecture-with-sass-smacss-and-bem-cc618392c148) for structuring SASS projects (**base**, **modules**, **layout**, **theme**, **state**) and because it's my first time using it, I should have several mistakes in the way how I decided to order and clasificate the different stylesheets, but I'll continue learning more along the way as always.

    - First, I wasn't sure about what exactly was **theme**, I mean, typography and colors, ok ... but code? or variables?, I chose the second option. In most of the cases I assigned a folder for each topic with the same name as the document, but there is one exception ... the theme folder, I decided to call it **members** basically because that's how are known those things in SASS (variables, mixins, extends, etc...) and inside of it I created 2 [partials](https://sass-lang.com/guide), one of them called **theme** that as you might guess has the colors and fonts variables and the other called **mixins** (I guess there's no need for explications).

    - Second, in a course that I was watching, the teacher said that we should separate the layout stylesheets into 2 sub-stylesheet, one of them with the "layout" properties in essence (like position, grid, flexbox, width, etc...) and the second one with the "styles" (colors, fonts, etc...), therefore in the layout folder there are 2 stylesheets, one of them called "layout.scss" and the other one called "layout-styles.scss".

    - Third, the way how I separated the different pages' styles was by adding different comments. On each important component I put a comment as a box (first example below), and when a component was something general (I mean, that I used it more than once because is something needed in each page like the nav or the footer) I created a comment a few different from the box-comment (second example below) to difference them, and for separating the components according to their pages I created a comment alike to the one mentioned before but with the name of the page the components are related to (third example below).

* Now, I also learned how to optimize the page load by doing a few things:

    - Compressing images to make them lighter by using [Tinypng](https://tinypng.com/).

    - Converting those compressed images (wich could be jpg, png, etc...) into webp images by using [Webp converter](https://imagen.online-convert.com/es/convertir-a-webp).

    - Using both formats thanks to the [picture element](https://www.w3schools.com/htmL/html_images_picture.asp) in HTML.

* Furthermore I learned how to change the tab's color by using the meta tag [theme-color](https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/hints/hint-meta-theme-color/#:~:text=The%20theme-color%20meta%20tag%20provides%20a%20way%20to,highlight%20in%20a%20tab%20bar%20or%20task%20switcher.) and I found out that the ideal size for Facebook Open Graph images should be 1200x630 according to their own [documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters/images), this is because that way the definition is perfect for most of the screens.

* I also tried to get a better lighthouse performance by using lighter image formats as webp and avif instead of jpg or png, that way the charge of the site in general is faster (avif still needs a bit more support, it has 67% now, that's the reason why I put it as the second option in the fallback). Furthermore, I added the full URL direction to each and every element that needs a source (I've already explained why in the [easy-recipe](https://github.com/said-alrove/easy-recipe) project).

> That'd be everything for this project! :D.

> **P.D.** I added a couple mixins for creating Flexbox and Grid layouts faster (I just have to put the kind of mixin I'll use, either Flexbox or Grid and specify each variable. I assigned a shorter name for each propertie where was possible, e.g. **justify-content** > **jt-content** with its value).

> **Note:** if you want to check out those mixins to see how they work, you must go to the members folder and check the mixins file.
